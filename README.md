# jk2PRO

This is a modification for Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast Multiplayer.

The primary goals for this mod are as follows:

* To provide the best environment for defragging in Jedi Knight II, supporting all versions.
* To properly track racing/defragging scores with demo recording & player times.
* To remove/patch unwanted gameplay related exploits.
* To add netcode features such as lag compensation for hitscan and projectiles, clientside simulated projectiles, etc.
* To add a simple admin system, with little potential for abuse.
* To add support for a race gametype, similar to racesow in warsow or defrag in quake 3, with player isolation, accounts, & persistent highscores.
* To enhance the default features & to improve them as needed.  

All features will be able to be configured, so that no gameplay changes will interfere with default JK2 settings.

## Compiling
Use the batch files (cgame.bat, game.bat, etc.) in each module's proper directory to compile the Quake Virtual Machines (*.qvm).

## Maintainers
* slaytan1c (Darth Martyr)
